set up the project then create an app 

and mention the entry of the app in the installed apps 
and in templates section of settings update dirs

in the app urls.py 
add
from django.urls import path
from . import views 

now we setup the models for this project one will be for the chatroom and one will be for the messages 

so in models.py
in models.py 
first import 

from datatime import datetime //this will give the current date and time

now after creating the model we have to make migrations..
so python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate

now we create a superuser by typing the command in the vscode terminal 
python manage.py createsuperuser

your credentials are username:gandharvesolanki
                     password:Solanki@123
                     
                     
Now we have to register this models in our admin file 
so in admin.py 
from .models import Room,Message
above two models you created 


and then we gotta register the model and we do that by

admin.site.register(Room)
admin.site.register(Message)

now what we want to implement is when someone types the room name and wants to enter the room a new link should open where user gets entered into the room 
so for that if the room already exists we should just add the user into the room and if the user does not exist then we should create a new roon ..


so in our app urls.py
now we set paths for the rooms there can be many rooms so we have to use dynamic routing

so our form in home.html will be posting to checkview url and at these url we do the checking so import the models also in views.py

now the form which is present in the  room.html we will submit that form with the help of ajax

With Ajax, web applications can send and retrieve data from a server asynchronously without interfering with the display and behaviour of the existing page.

to load ajax below script should be there
<script   src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.1.1.min.js"   integrity="sha256-hVVnYaiADRTO2PzUGmuLJr8BLUSjGIZsDYGmIJLv2b8="   crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
