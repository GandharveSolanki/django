if you are entering data in to the form then you are sending a post request and that post request will be sent to   <form action="register" method="post">
action="register" route  a post request will be sent now you have to handle that in views.py 

now as i said a post req will be sent so you will get data on register route and you have to handle that data 
so do this 
def register(request):
    if request.method=='POST':
        first_name=request.POST['name']
        username=request.POST['username']
        email=request.POST['email']
        phone=request.POST['phone_number']
        password=request.POST['password']
        password_again=request.POST['pass']
    return render(request,'register.html')
    
    by doing above you get the data from the database but how will you save that data in your database  you can create a model and do that thing but django provide you 
    with user model object it is there in the user framework ..
    
    The way you use it is you import it in views.py 
    from django.contrib.auth.models import User,auth //for login path also import auth 
    
    now lets save the above data so create an user object
