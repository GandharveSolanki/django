if you are entering data in to the form then you are sending a post request and that post request will be sent to   <form action="register" method="post">
action="register" route  a post request will be sent now you have to handle that in views.py 

now as i said a post req will be sent so you will get data on register route and you have to handle that data 
so do this 
def register(request):
    if request.method=='POST':
        name=request.POST['name']
        username=request.POST['username']
        email=request.POST['email']
        phone=request.POST['phone_number']
        password1=request.POST['password']
        password2=request.POST['pass']
    return render(request,'register.html')
    
    by doing above you get the data from the database but how will you save that data in your database  you can create a model and do that thing but django provide you 
    with user model object it is there in the user framework ..
    
    The way you use it is you import it in views.py 
    from django.contrib.auth.models import User,auth //for login path also import auth 
    
    now lets save the above data so create an user object 
    
    
    user=User.objects.create_user( username=username,password=password1,email=email,first_name=name)
    see username ,password ,email all these fields are available in the model object.. now as you have created the object you hvae to now save this data.
    by user.save()
    then redirect to the home page 
    return redirect('/')
    but before using this you have to import it so you must be having this statement from django.shortcuts import render
    so update this to from django.shortcuts import render,redirect
    in above brackets you pass all the parameters..
    
    also remember to add {% csrf_token %} after <form action=""> statement 
    
    now some authentication stuffs
    before that if you want to see if some statement is getting executed or not just do print('anything') this will print shit in the console so you can debug 
    
    now add this in your function in views..
