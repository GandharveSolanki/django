use command 
work on random(random is name of my environment)
then python manage.py startapp accounts
this creates an app 
then create urls.py in that app 


//copy this in your urls.py
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns=[
    path('',views.register,name='register')
]

then in views.py do this 
defind the register function ...


after that in (main) urls.py of project 
do the routing 
 path('register/',include('accounts.urls') )
 
 now the path will be http://127.0.0.1:8000/register/
 if you want the path to be http://127.0.0.1:8000/register/random/
 then make 
 urlpatterns=[
    path('random',views.register,name='register')
]
 add above statement and then you are good to go 
 create html page in template
