in settings file you will find a section such as database 

include /update these things 


DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': 'firstproject', #this is your database name
        'USER':'postgres',   #pg admin4 username &password below
        'PASSWORD':'Solanki@123',
        'HOST':'localhost'  //specify on which machine you have this database 
    }
}

//these are the above things you need to specify for connecting with databases but postres being a diff soft and django being a diff software how will they connect 

so in vs code terminal do pip install psycopg2 //this is a connector  

now if you want to convert a class into a model then you have to give that class more power and you can do that by speiyfing models.Model in the parenthesis and 
with orm concept the tables will get created auto matically but still you have to do a lot 



class Destination(models.Model):
    name=models.CharField(max_length=100)
    img=models.ImageField()
    desc=models.TextField()
    price=models.IntegerField()
    offer=models.BooleanField(default=False)


now if you have to create a table you have to migrate your models to the database for that you have to pass a command 
python manage.py makemigrations
and before this you have to mention in settings 
in installed apps section ...
you have to mention your application name whatever you are working with 
add this in it 
'travelwebsite.apps.TravelwebsiteConfig',
see travelwebsite is the name of your app and remember with Config the first letter of the app should be capital ..

do pip install pillow if it is not there 

after this python manage.py makemigrations
and all your migrations will be done 

but still a table is not made there because we have just created a migrations file 

so now have to write this command  
python manage.py sqlmigrate travelwebsite 0001

now after this just one more command 
python manage.py migrate 

now you will get a table from your table from a class that is the magic of orm
