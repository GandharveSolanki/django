once you have python and pip installed 

now for diff projects you should have diff config of django 
lets say you are working with diff projects and you want to have diff set of django there 
so basically you want a seperate space for your project from the entire system such that which will not be affecting the other projects you have  

and the way you can do that is by installing virtual environment wrapper 
in cmd type 
pip install virtualenvwrapper-win

after this we get the setup for the environment 
now we actually we want to create that environment 

so in cmd type mkvirtualenv projectEnv

you have created environment name as projectEnv in your system also..
now once you are in the environment then you have to install django 
once in projectEnv type pip install django 

now we have installed django in our environment 

create a sperate folder in E drive lets say you made a project name djangoprojects

now create a project by django-admin startproject SecondProject 
now if you see that SecondProject you will see manage.py file and one folder now this will only get created if you are in your virtual environment 
otherwise you gotta activate your virtual environment if somehow after creating your firtual environment you closed cmd accidently 


so activate the virtual environment use workon projectEnv

and this is all it open this project with vs code 

or if you want to run the server with cmd you can cd SecondProject
then you can do python manage.py runserver


now next steps 

open in vs code in terminal type workon projectEnv

now in your project you will have differnet apps like if you are making an ecommerce you will have login system as a diff app and cart system as diff app etc


so to create apps we use python manage.py startapp calc
this will create app named as calc
