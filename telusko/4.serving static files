step1-create a static folder in your project and then add images,styles and js folder in it..

now we have to specify the path for this static f

older so that django can look into it..

so go to settings file and 

this cleared all doubts related to static files https://www.educba.com/django-static-files/

now after you are done with step 1  

but your django should know where to look for these files 

so in settings file 
you will have this STATIC_URL = '/static/'

so we will inform django where it will find all the static files by 
STATICFILES_DIRS = [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static'), ]

ok now django know you have all static files in this static folder but django wants to pick all these files and wants to put in his own created folder basically a django
folder for better process 

so we do that by STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'assets')///so django will put all the static files in this folder but way you refer the static files is by 
STATIC_URL = '/static/'

now you have to tell django to create this folder assets 
python manage.py collectstatic

now after doing all this you have to make changes in your html files also 

in top of the html file add 
{% load static %}
in every href of images or css you have to add {%static%}

like this <link rel="stylesheet" href="{%static 'css/style.css' %}">


<img src="{%static 'images/1.jpg' %}" alt="">
<script src="{%static 'js/script.js' %}"></script>
now you are done

like example
