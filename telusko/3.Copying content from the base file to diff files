lets say you have project page so the layot /design for all the products pages will be same right  only the info will be diff and that will come from database ..

so lets say for all the product pages you create a base file and you have your base content and the content which you want to reuse again and again can be kept between

 {% block content %}
  <h1>Hello my G</h1>
  {% endblock %}
